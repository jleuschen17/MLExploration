# Evaluating Feed Forward NN and LSTM Networks against Traditional ML Approaches
#### Author: Joe Leuschen
## Abstract
This project explores the implementation of a three-layer feed-forward neural network on two datasets: a custom dataset of 31 data points and the popular MNIST digit dataset. For the custom dataset, different training and testing splits are experimented with, and the resulting least-square errors are compared betIen the neural network and previously used regression models, including linear, parabolic, and polynomial functions. For the MNIST dataset, the first 20 PCA modes of the digit images are computed and used to build a feed-forward neural network. The model is trained and its performance is compared with other classifiers, namely LSTM, SVM (support vector machines), and decision trees. The complete analysis provides valuable insights into the applicability and efficacy of neural networks for different types of data and allows for an understanding of the strengths and Iaknesses of different modeling approaches.
## Introduction
In this project, I investigate the applicability and efficacy of three-layer feed-forward neural networks in modeling and classifying data from two different datasets: a custom dataset consisting of 31 real-valued data points and the widely used MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits. Various aspects of neural networks, such as training, testing, and comparison with other methods, are explored in detail, providing a comprehensive understanding of their advantages and limitations compared to conventional regression models and classification techniques.

Initially, the custom dataset is fitted using a three-layer feed-forward neural network, folloId by an analysis of the least-square errors across different training and testing data splits. This is done to better understand the neural network's performance compared to linear, parabolic, and polynomial functions previously applied to this dataset. Thereafter, the focus is shifted to the MNIST dataset, where the first 20 PCA modes of the digit images are computed and used as input features for the neural network-based classifier.

Following the implementation of a feed-forward neural network for the MNIST dataset, its performance is evaluated and compared against other popular classification techniques, including Long-Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Trees. The results obtained from this analysis highlight the strengths and Iaknesses of neural networks as a modeling and classification tool, offering valuable insights into their suitability for various types of data and problem-solving scenarios.

Throughout the course of this project, various important concepts and methods are employed, such as data preprocessing, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), PCA, and a wide array of machine learning techniques. As a result, a deeper understanding of the subject matter is attained, particularly concerning the use of neural networks for data modeling and classification tasks.

## Theoretical Background

A feed-forward neural network is a type of artificial neural network in which information flows from input to output through various interconnected layers, without any loops or cycles. Three-layer feed-forward neural networks consist of an input layer, hidden layer, and an output layer. This configuration is useful in capturing the non-linear relationships within the data, allowing for much more complex and accurate models compared to linear regression techniques.

For the supervised learning aspect of the project, the learning algorithms rely on labeled data for training and optimization purposes. In this context, an algorithm in supervised learning learns to map input data to output labels by minimizing a predefined loss function. Specifically, neural networks utilized for classification tasks are optimized using an error metric, like cross-entropy loss, to compare predicted labels with actual labels. Throughout the learning process, the Iights and biases within the network layers are adjusted to minimize the loss function, which helps the model to generalize to new, unseen data.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) refers to a linear dimensionality reduction technique that is widely used in data analysis, visualization, and preprocessing. By computing the first few principal components of the dataset, one can capture the significant majority of the variation within the dataset while significantly reducing the input feature dimensions. In this project, PCA is employed as a preprocessing step on the MNIST dataset, using the first 20 principal components as input features for the neural network classifier. The technique aids in reducing computational complexity and helps the algorithm converge faster during training.

As part of the project, comparative analysis of the neural network-based classification methods with other popular techniques, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Long-Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM), and Decision Trees, is conducted. Each of these approaches possesses its advantages and limitations. For instance, SVMs are suitable for high-dimensional spaces and small sample sizes, while Decision Trees are highly interpretable and robust against outliers. On the other hand, LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network that can capture long-range dependencies and make predictions in sequences, which is highly practical for time-series data.

In conclusion, this project brings together essential machine learning concepts, including feed-forward neural networks, supervised learning, PCA, and various classification techniques to analyze and model complex data. By thoroughly understanding the strengths and limitations of these methods and applying them effectively, valuable insights can be drawn from the data, driving better decision-making and problem-solving in real-world scenarios.


## Algorithm Analysis

### Problem I: Fitting a Neural Network Model

1. Import the necessary libraries and define the dataset.

```python
import numpy as np
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
```

Load the data and create tensors for each point in X and Y.

```python
X = torch.tensor(np.arange(0, 31), dtype=torch.float32).view(-1, 1)
Y = torch.tensor(np.array([30, 35, 33, 32, 34, 37, 39, 38, 36, 36, 37, 39, 42, 45, 45, 41, 40, 39, 42, 44, 47, 49, 50, 49, 46, 48, 50, 53, 55, 54, 53]), dtype=torch.float32).view(-1, 1)
```

2. Define the neural network model class.

```python
class NeuralNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(NeuralNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(1, 32)
        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(32, 64)
        self.layer3 = nn.Linear(64, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.layer1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.layer2(x))
        x = self.layer3(x)
        return x
```

3. Split the training and test datasets depending on the case, train the neural network model with the specified number of epochs, and compute the least-square error.

```python
def train_and_test_nn(train_indices, test_indices, epochs):
    model = NeuralNetwork()
    optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
    criterion = nn.MSELoss()

    train_X = X[train_indices]
    train_Y = Y[train_indices]
    test_X = X[test_indices]
    test_Y = Y[test_indices]

    num_epochs = epochs
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(train_X)
        loss = criterion(output, train_Y)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        if (epoch % 100) == 0:
            print(f"Epoch {epoch} loss: {loss}")

    preds_train = model(train_X)
    train_loss = criterion(preds_train, train_Y)

    preds_test = model(test_X)
    test_loss = criterion(preds_test, test_Y)
    return train_loss, test_loss
```

4. Train and test the models for both cases (different train test splits) and print the results.

```python
print("Case (ii): First 20 points as training data")
train_error, test_error = train_and_test_nn(np.arange(20), np.arange(20, 30), 2000)
print(f"\nTrain Error: {train_error}\nTest Error: {test_error}")

print("\nCase (iii): First 10 and last 10 points as training data")
train_error2, test_error2 = train_and_test_nn(np.hstack([np.arange(10), np.arange(21, 31)]), np.arange(10, 21), 2000)
print(f"\nTrain Error: {train_error2}\nTest Error: {test_error2}")
```

### Problem II: Comparison of Classifiers on the MNIST Dataset

1. Load the MNIST dataset and preprocess it.

```python
transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor(), transforms.Normalize((0.1307,), (0.3081,))])
train_dataset = torchvision.datasets.MNIST('~/.torch/datasets', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)
test_dataset = torchvision.datasets.MNIST('~/.torch/datasets', train=False, download=True, transform=transform)
```

2. Compute the first 20 PCA modes of the digit images.

```python
train_data = train_dataset.data.numpy().reshape(-1, 28*28)
pca = PCA(n_components=20)
pca.fit(train_data)
print(f'First 20 PCA Modes:\n{pca.components_}')
```

3. Train a feed-forward neural network to classify the digits

Create data loaders
```python
train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)
test_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(test_dataset, batch_size=1000)
```

Define the feed-forward neural network model class.

```python
class FeedForwardNN(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc1 = torch.nn.Linear(28 * 28, 256)
        self.fc2 = torch.nn.Linear(256, 128)
        self.fc3 = torch.nn.Linear(128, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x
```

Initialize the model, loss function, and optimizer.

```python
    model = FeedForwardNN()
    criterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
    optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
```

Train the neural network

```python
num_epochs = 10
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch_idx, (data, targets) in enumerate(train_loader):
        data = data.view(data.size(0), -1)
        predictions = model(data)

        loss = criterion(predictions, targets)
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

    print(f'Epoch [{epoch + 1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')
```

Compute test accuracy for the model
```python
correct = 0
total = 0
with torch.no_grad():
    for data, targets in test_loader:
        data = data.view(data.size(0), -1)
        predictions = model(data)
        _, predicted = torch.max(predictions.data, 1)
        total += targets.size(0)
        correct += (predicted == targets).sum().item()

print(f'Accuracy of the network on the 10000 test images: {100 * correct / total:.2f}')
```
Results:

```
Accuracy of the network on the 10000 test images: 96.49
```

4. Prepping data for SVM, LSTM, and Decision Tree Classifiers

```python
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
X_train = X_train.reshape(60000, 784).T
X_test = X_test.reshape(10000, 784).T
```

5. Decision tree classifier and SVM algorithms are implemented and trained on the MNIST dataset.

```python
# Tree
tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=44)
tree.fit(X_train.T, y_train)
y_pred_tree = tree.predict(X_test.T)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_tree)
print(accuracy)

#SVM
svm = SVC(probability=False)
svm.fit(X_train.T, y_train)
y_pred_svm = svm.predict(X_test.T)
accuracy_svm = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_svm)
print(accuracy_svm)
```

Accuracy Scores: 
```
Decision Tree: 0.8769
Support Vector Machine: 0.9792
```

6. Create, train, and test LSTM model

        super(MnistLSTM, self).__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size

    def forward(self, x):
        h0 = torch.zeros(self.num_layers, x.size(0), self.hidden_size).cuda()
        c0 = torch.zeros(self.num_layers, x.size(0), self.hidden_size).cuda()

        out, _ = self.lstm(x, (h0, c0))

        out = self.fc(out[:, -1, :])
        return out

input_size = 28
hidden_size = 128
num_layers = 2
num_classes = 10
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')

model = MnistLSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, num_classes).to(device)

criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

num_epochs = 10

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for i, (images, labels) in enumerate(train_loader):
        images = images.reshape(-1, 28, 28).to(device)
        labels = labels.to(device)

        # Forward pass
        outputs = model(images)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)

        # Backward pass
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

        if (i + 1) % 100 == 0:
            print('Epoch [{}/{}], Step [{}/{}], Loss: {:.4f}'.format(epoch + 1, num_epochs, i + 1, len(train_loader),
                                                                     loss.item()))

with torch.no_grad():
    correct = 0
    total = 0

    for images, labels in test_loader:
        images = images.reshape(-1, 28, 28).to(device)
        labels = labels.to(device)
        outputs = model(images)
        _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)
        total += labels.size(0)

## Summary and Conclusion

### Problem I: Fitting a Neural Network Model

In this problem, I fit a 3-layer feed forward neural network to the data points from Homework 1. I employed two different training data sets: first 20 data points, and a combination of the first 10 and last 10 data points. The neural network attained least-square errors of 4.74 for the first training data set and 1.85 for the second training data set. When tested on the remaining data points, the network produced errors of 6.22 and 7.46, respectively.

Furthermore, I compared these results to the models fitted in Homework 1, which are linear, quadratic, and 19th-degree polynomial regression. For the first training set, the neural network outperformed the quadratic and 19th-degree polynomial models but performed worse than the linear model on the test data. For the second training set, the neural network underperformed in a similar fashion on test data. 

### Problem II: Comparison of Classifiers on the MNIST Dataset

In this problem, I analyzed the classifiers' performance (namely, LSTM, SVM, and decision tree classifiers) on the MNIST dataset by comparing the accuracy scores. I also computed the first 20 PCA modes of the digits as required.

The computed accuracy scores for the classifiers Ire as follows:

- Feed Forward Neural Network: 96.74 %
- Decision Tree: 87.69 %
- Support Vector Machine: 97.92 %
- LSTM Neural Network: 98.92 %

The LSTM neural network achieved the highest accuracy of 98.92 %, while the Decision Tree had the lowest with 87.69 %. It is also noteworthy that the feed forward network attained an accuracy score close to the SVM model.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, for the given data, the feed forward neural network performed reasonably well for the first training data set but didn't yield any discernible advantage over the linear model. For the second training data set similar results were found.

For the MNIST dataset, the LSTM neural network outperforms the other classifiers, achieving the highest accuracy in correct classification. However, the feed forward network performed almost as well as the SVM classifier and LSTM model. This indicates the LSTM's effectiveness in classifying the MNIST dataset, with the Feed Forward Neural Network as a viable alternative.
